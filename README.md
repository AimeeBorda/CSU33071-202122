# CSU33071-202122

A collection of test cases for the [ToY Compiler](https://tcd.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-2193995-dt-content-rid-13052464_1/xid-13052464_1)

Please add a single test-case in each text-file. Each file must have the following header:

```
## Group XX

## - Partner1
## - Partner2

## Valid: Yes/No

## Description:
```

Remember, the group is awarded 0.5pt (up to 10 pts) for every test-case uploaded such that
- non trivial
- it documents in comments what behaviour (positive or negative) it is testing.
- no-one else has posted a test for similar behaviour on the forum yet at the time of submission.


It is highly encouraged to test your compiler against submitted test-cases by your peers.
